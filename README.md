# HTML and CSS Template.


Vincent Santaygillo

Make sure you have flask and installed in your Python Environment.

This is a basic template for using HTML and CSS with flask.

Steps for MessageCSS:

    1. Download the MessageCSS folder.
    2. Run script.py using CMD.
    3. Access the default localhost URL( "http://localhost:5000/" is the default).
  
    Note: Notice that the folder arragement is important when using render_template and also when using css. Make sure that you structure your folder identical to mine if you are planning to modify it.
